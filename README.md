# 2DAM Python Exercises - Programming services and processes

This repository contains a number of exercises carried out within the framework of the 2nd year of studies of the Higher Level Technical Course in Multi-platform Application Development (2DAM). The focus of the exercises is on programming ‘services and processes’ using Python.

## Introduction

The exercises are intended to address the key concepts as follows:
- Concepts of **Multithreading** and how it is controlled.
- Mechanisms of **synchronization of processes**.

## Structure of the project

The repository has orderly divided into folders, each of which contains exercises based on certain topics:
- **Threads and their synchronization techniques.**
- **Problems related to Producer and consumer.**
- **Dealing with Deadlocks.**
- **Designing applications that will employ multiple threads.**

In each folder, you will find Python codes for the exercises with some explanation of each problem and its corresponding solution.
